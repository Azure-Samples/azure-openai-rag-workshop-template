# ðŸ¤– azure-openai-rag-workshop

In this workshop, we will build a chatbot from based on OpenAI language models and implementing the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern. You'll use [Fastify](https://fastify.dev) to create a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) service that leverage [OpenAI SDK](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries/) and [LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/) to build a chatbot that will answer questions based on a corpus of documents, as well as a website to test it.

<!-- Finally, we will deploy everything on Azure with a CI/CD pipeline. -->

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js v18+**
- **Docker v20+**
- **Azure account**. If you're new to Azure, [get an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=javascript-0000-cxa) to get free Azure credits to get started.
- **Azure subscription with access enabled for the Azure OpenAI service**. You can request access with [this form](https://aka.ms/oaiapply).

You can use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to work on this project directly from your browser: select the **Code** button, then the **Codespaces** tab and click on **Create Codespaces on main**.

You can also use the [Dev Containers extension for VS Code](https://aka.ms/vscode/ext/devcontainer) to work locally using a ready-to-use dev environment.

## Project details

This project is structured as monorepo and makes use of [NPM Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/using-npm/workspaces).

## How to run locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This command will start the frontend and backend services.
For these services to work, you need to have a `.env` file at the root of the project with at least the following content:

```bash
AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE=<your_azure_cognitive_search_instance_name>
AZURE_OPENAI_URL=<you_openai_instance_url>
```

The application will then be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## How to build Docker images

```bash
npm run docker:build
```

This command will build the container images for all services.

## How deploy to Azure

```bash
azd auth login
azd up
```

This commands will first ask you to log in into Azure. Then it will provison the Azure resources, package the services and deploy them to Azure.
